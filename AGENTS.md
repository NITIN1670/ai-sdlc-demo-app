# Project conventions for AI agents

Invoice approval demo app: ASP.NET Core 8 Web API with a small static web UI.

## Layout

- `backend/src/InvoiceApp.Domain`: business rules, no web or storage code. `ApprovalService` owns the invoice lifecycle (Draft, PendingApproval, Approved, Rejected).
- `backend/src/InvoiceApp.Api`: controllers, sign-in (`Auth/`), in-memory repository, and the web UI under `wwwroot/`.
- `backend/tests/InvoiceApp.Tests`: xUnit tests, one test class per class under test, named `<ClassUnderTest>Tests`.
- `docs/use-cases`: short briefs for features we may build.

## Conventions

- Controllers live in `Controllers/`, one per resource, route `api/[controller]`. Request bodies are `record` types declared inside the controller.
- Controllers inherit `ApiControllerBase` and use `Handle(...)` so service errors map to 404, 409 and 400.
- Every endpoint is behind sign-in. Restrict actions with `[RequireRole("...")]`: destructive actions are Admin only, approvals are Approver or Admin.
- Business rules go in the Domain project, never in controllers.
- Register services in `Program.cs`. Repositories are interfaces in Domain with an in-memory implementation in Api.
- Every new rule or endpoint needs tests. Use `FakeInvoiceRepository` in tests.
- Use clear names; no one-letter variables or `flag` parameters.

## Commands

- Run the app: `dotnet run --project backend/src/InvoiceApp.Api` then open http://localhost:5000
- Run the tests: `dotnet test backend/InvoiceApp.sln`

## Demo accounts (not real credentials)

- `demo.approver` / `ChangeMe123!` (role Approver)
- `demo.admin` / `ChangeMe123!` (role Admin)

## Never

- Commit real credentials, tokens or customer data.
- Add business logic to `Program.cs` or controllers.
